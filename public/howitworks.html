	<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>
	At 2 Bob’s Worth you can submit a small need for someone to help you with (Opportunity), and earn a few “Bob” by volunteering to help people with small needs.
</p>
<p>
	“Bob” are points that in future may earn you rewards at local venues or from our sponsors.
</p>
<div style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
	This is how it works:</div><br/>

<table border=1>
	<tr>
		<td style="font-weight: bold;">I Can Help</td>
		<td style="font-weight: bold;">I Need Help</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="vertical-align: top; padding: 5px;" width="50%">
			<p>1. Search for an Opportunity by clicking on I can Help.</p>

			<p>2. If you find an Opportunity you are interested in, sign up, create your user profile and we’ll send off your offer to help.</p>

			<p>3. If you like, 2 Bob’s Worth will monitor the requests for help as they are submitted and will contact you by e-mail or SMS when your skills and interests match the request.</p>

			<p>4. If your offer to help is accepted, we’ll send also send you a message.  You can then confirm you are still available to help, and get directions to the location.</p>

			<p>5. Once the job is completed, the person you’ve helped can send you a thank-you and rate your performance! (Don’t worry, you can also rate the request for help in terms of whether your help was really needed).</p>

			<p>By increasing your rating as a trusted helper, you will earn respect and be able to readily help more people.</p>

			<p>4.  If you accept the help offer, the helper will be notified and you can send them the address for the Opportunity.</p>
